# Robotic-Arm-Automation - Proof of Concept
Overview

This project presents a proof-of-concept robotic arm automation system developed during the early pre-production phase at Boston Scientific, Galway.
The objective was to explore automation techniques for precision handling, assembly, and demonstration tasks in biomedical device development.
The robotic arm was programmed through its native control interface connected via a computer, allowing direct coding and task command execution.

### Repository Contents

- **src/** – Python codes for robotic arm task sequences (writing, gluing, soldering, testing)
